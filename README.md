# ManilaAutoShow2025
Project link: https://lennorrodriguez08.github.io/ManilaAutoShow2025/

This is one of my personal projects to showcase my skills in web development.
This project is purely created from scratch without using any CSS/JS frameworks.

Web Technologies/Resources I used on this project
- HTML5
- SCSS/CSS3
- CSS Utilities/Components that I made
- Responsive Web Design
- Vanilla JS ( I used JS here mostly for DOM Manipulation)
- Photoshop (For basic image manipulation like resizing and file compression)
- Fontawesome (For my web icons)
- Unsplash.com (Image source)
- Visual Studio Code (I always use it as my code editor and by using one of its extensions, I am able to use this as well as my SCSS compiler).
